The creation of the EDHEC Singapore Infrastructure Investment Institute springs from the past 4 years of research on infrastructure investment at EDHEC-Risk Institute and the continuous support of the Monetary Authority of Singapore in supporting cutting hedge research that can bring new and valuable knowledge to institutional investors, asset managers and regulators. Based in Singapore, EDHEC infra aims to create a global repository of financial knowledge and investment benchmarks about infrastructure equity and debt investment, with a focus on delivering applied research in finance for investors in infrastructure. We aim to deliver the best available estimates of financial performance and risks of reference portfolios of privately held infrastructure investments, and thus provide investors with important insights about their strategic asset allocation choices to infrastructure, as well as support the adequate calibration of the relevant prudential frameworks. EDHEC infra benefits from unparalleled access to the financial data of infrastructure projects and firms, especially private data, that is either unavailable to market participants or too cumbersome and difficult to collect and aggregate. We also bring advanced asset pricing and risk measurement technology designed to answer investors’ information needs about long-term investment in privately held infrastructure, from asset allocation to prudential regulation and performance attribution and monitoring.
EDHEC Singapore Infrastructure Investment Institute, part of EDHEC Business School is looking for an analyst to help develop a database of infrastructure project financial statements under the supervision of the Institute’s Head of Data Collection (ACCA).

The position
This is an opportunity for recent graduate with accounting, finance or economics majors to develop in-depth knowledge of infrastructure projects and the financial arrangements that support them. Beginning with the analysis and input of financial statements, the role will require research and analysis of infrastructure projects, and companies with a focus on collecting and updating financial data in the largest worldwide database of unlisted infrastructure assets.
The candidate must be detail oriented with a willingness to learn. An understanding of financial accounts is desirable and willing to spend time reading detailed project documentation to extract the relevant information and populate a data file. Prior knowledge of Microsoft Office Suite is essential. Knowledge of a European language would be an advantage.
This is a full-time, on-going position.
Remuneration is competitive and includes a bonus for meeting performance objectives.
Attractive salary and bonus, healthcare and pension plan coverage.
The salary will be determined according to EDHEC's pay scale, the candidate's qualifications and experience.
To apply for this offer, please send a CV and a cover letter to: recruitment@edhec-dbd.com.
